			<p>My name is Sunhee Baik. I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. As part of my research, I am exploring how people use and value electricity in both normal circumstances and when a power outage occurs. As part of my research which is funded by the National Science Foundation, I am exploring how people use and value electricity in both normal circumstances and when a power outage occurs.
		<br><br><strong>What is the purpose of my study?</strong>
		<br>The information I collect in this study will help me understand how people use electricity in their homes and how much they value their electricity services. It will also give me some indication of which electric appliances people would want to use if they could only receive partial service during a power outage, and why they choose to use them. With the results, I will identify strategies that can assure the continued provision of electricity in the event of long outages of grid power across wide geographical regions.
		<br><br><strong>What will I ask you to do in this study?</strong>
		<br>You will be asked to answer several questions about your household. Next, I will assume a hypothetical large regional blackout occur in late December. Then you will be asked whether further information changes your perceptions or not. Last, you will be asked to answer some questions regarding your demographic information, your electricity bill, and your experience of outages in the past. 
		<br><br>Your participation in this study is voluntary and your responses will be anonymous. If you would like to receive a summary of the results when my study is completed, please fill in the mailing label below.
		<br><br><strong>How long will it take?</strong><br>
		It will take roughly XX minutes to complete the survey.
		<br><br><strong>Who can participate in this study?</strong>
		<br>To participate, you must be:
		<br>Adults who are 18 years or older
		<br>Have lived in Northeastern region (Vermont, New Jersey, New Hampshire or New York) for 3 years or more 
		(It is okay if you moved between different parts of Northeastern Region during that time)
		<br>Your household should have at least 2 adults including yourself Compensations
		<br>You will be reimbursed $Z for your participation in this study.
		<br>What are the benefits of participating in this study? 
		<br>Participation will give you a chance to think about your use of electricity and help you to be prepared for further disruptions.

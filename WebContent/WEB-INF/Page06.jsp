In addition to paying for the actual electricity you use, your monthly 
electricity bill includes charges for performing maintenance on the 
electricity system (e.g., distribution lines, transformers, etc.) and some
 limited protection of the system against blackouts. However, the bill does
  not include charges to provide electric services in the event of an 
  unpredictable blackout. In this case, the National Weather Service (NWS)
   could predict the tornadoes; yet, utilities could not prevent the 
   blackout because it was too wide-spread, and they did not have enough 
   time to prepare for the disruption.

Suppose that during the blackout there is a private local service that 
specializes in disasters and emergencies that can quickly hook up a 
generator to your house and provide all the electric power you would have 
normally used. Assume your cell phone has enough power to call to get that
 service and obtain a one-time payment for one day of immediate service 
 provided by the company. You will receive a bill for the payment by mail.
